## HackerScience.net

## So wtf is this ?
HackerScience.net is a small blog about all things technology that anyone can contribute too.

## Philosophy

When we use the word hacker we are usually referring to the guy using a black terminal with green font but hacker in essence is aa maker a doer and a builder they are someone who solves and enjoys solving problems and challenges through a creative and unconventional manner. 

So in the spirit of doing and making I have decided to create sort of a homage to the hacker/maker sub culture and to FOSS community.
